# gorsa

yes I'd developed a rsa integration for golang because I want to learn golang and modern cryptography (I mean I didn't understand the backgrounds behind rsa but yes).

Download the dependencies: `go mod get` and start the tests with `go test -v github.com/adridevelopsthings/gorsa/test`. Also you can use it as the test files explain. Good luck.
